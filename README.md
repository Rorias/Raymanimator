# Raymanimator

Raymanimator is an open source community project created by [Rorias](https://github.com/Rorias). The purpose of this program is to allow creating and editing rayman animations for Rayman 1, Rayman 3 GBA and more. This program comes with the spritesets for multiple games and a few example animations.

To install a version, simply select "Releases" on the right-hand side of the repository and download the appropriate zip file.
Unzip and run the .exe to start animating :)
